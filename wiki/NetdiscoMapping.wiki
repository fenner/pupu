#summary Mapping of users to locations based on access point associations in netdisco

= Introduction =

[http://netdisco.org netdisco] is an open-source network management system that discovers the network and discovers where nodes are on the network.  It can walk Access Point MIBs and get the association tables.

These additions add a mapping of access points to physical maps.

= To Do =

 * More Documentation
 * Handle useport=1 i.e. central controllers that have APs as ports
 * implement atom feed as well as rss
 * Use Mason for image generation
 * Share code for mapping between
   * public_map
   * rss dhandler
   * overlay-db.png

= Configuration =

Change netdisco_apache_dir.conf to include

{{{
<LocationMatch "/netdisco/.*\.(html|rss|xml)$">
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlHandler netdisco::Mason
</LocationMatch>

<LocationMatch "/netdisco/maps/overlay.*\.png">
        SetHandler cgi-script
</LocationMatch>
}}}

(You may also need `Options +ExecCGI` in the `overlay.*.png` block)
