#
# Monitored variable list
# TAB seperated
# Format:
# OID<tab>expected value<tab>Pretty name<tab>autofix
# The expected value can be a string, in which case it must match
# exactly, or a regexp surrounded by slashes, in which case the
# regexp must match.  "expected value" may be empty (i.e. <tab><tab>),
# in which case the value is either informational only, or is
# a per-device value which is stored in the varsperdev file
# or a per-group value which is stored in the varspergroup file.
# Autofix defaults to yes if the expected value is a constant,
# meaning that if the expected value is
# different than the current value, you can snmpset it.  "NO" or "N"
# in the autofix field means don't try.  Defaults to no if the
# expected value is a regexp.
#
# If a value is specified in multiple files, the expected value is first
# taken from the per-AP, then from the per-group, then from the varlist.
