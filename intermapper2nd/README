Export maps and vertices in XML format:

Export -> Data File -> Maps -> Select All
                    -> Vertices -> Select All
(note that "all" is overkill but easier than saying
"pick name, id, ip address, ...)

xsltproc intermap2nd.xsl Maps.xsl > device.txt
<optionally edit device.txt to only include the ones you care about>
intermap2nd device.txt
