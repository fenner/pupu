#
# Monitored variable list
# TAB seperated
# Format:
# OID<tab>expected value<tab>Pretty name
# The expected value can be a string, in which case it must match
# exactly, or a regexp surrounded by slashes, in which case the
# regexp must match.  "expected value" may be empty (i.e. <tab><tab>),
# in which case the value is either informational only, or is
# a per-device value which is stored in the varsperdev file
# or a per-group value which is stored in the varspergroup file.
#
# If a value is specified in multiple files, the expected value is first
# taken from the per-AP, then from the per-group, then from the varlist.
